Pawns compiler source etc

Readme: You are reading it!

pawns.pl comp.pl: SWI-Prolog source for compiler (should be split up
        into more files)

The next few things are not needed here but currently must be in dir
where Pawns code is compiled

apply.h apply.c: src for higher order "apply", compiled and linked
        with executables
apply.adt: src for apply.h (generated by adtpp tool)
apply1.pns: obsolete Pawns source (basis of apply.c)
pawns.h builtin.h: stuff for some builtin types/fns; should be builtin.adt
        somewhere????

makefile: makefile

.bcdrc .exrc: Lee's bash environment stuff etc

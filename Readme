Pawns: a declarative/imperative language
(Pointer Assignment Without Nasty Surprises)
Initial development by Lee Naish

See http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/papers/pawns/ for an informal
introduction to the language (not necessarily up to date, or presented
particularly well, and the syntax is not what is supported).

http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/papers/pawnsshare/ has a paper on
the sharing analysis done in the compiler (the src version here is less up
to date than the paper and has several known bugs, meaning you can write
dodgey code and the compiler won't complain as it should).

The system is also not packaged well currently.

It needs

1) SWI-Prolog:
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog-nox

2) Boehm++ garbage collector:
sudo apt-get install libgc-dev

3) adtpp/adt4c tool installed in ~/bin/adtpp:
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/cjack/Adt4c
cd Adt4c/src
make install
(a more up to date version is at
https://bitbucket.org/Macnaa/adt4c-with-polymorphism.git)

4) pawns.h in current dir

5) gcc (other C compilers should be ok also)

--------------------------------------------------------------
We currently have

compiler: source for compiler

examples: example Pawns code (with makefile and other files needed etc)

bench: some benchmarks (binary tree insertion...) in various languages
